it's basically to test time.h I've just learned a while ago.
idk if conio.h is actually good to use, but I have no other choice(has to learnt it too)

this is just a demo. my goal is to create a clock that can actually run while you type new commands, and opening multiple clock at the same time
but that's just too complicated, I don't even know where to start, so I go back to basic CLI app with conio.

maybe in the future I will refactor this so that it work like what I wanted. controlling multiple cursor sound hard for me, by now.
