a repo from a newbie who have just learned code, and pretty much nothing to show

this repo consist of some ideas that I thought could be interesting, or could also be just a test program. do not treat it seriously. but at least it should have more things to mess up with than very small projects.

I'll keep adding more things here regularly.
