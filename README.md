- Move toward modular thinking  

## What qualifies as Level 4

- 300–1000 lines of code  
- Multiple features  
- Clear program structure  
- Usually single-entry main file  
- More complex logic than micro apps  

## Structure

    app_name/
        main_file

## Focus Areas

- Feature design  
- State handling  
- Code readability  
- Refactoring practice  

## Philosophy
