A smart calendar with multiple things you can do with(though not really optimized, I can't find a way to make it look fancier or changing it color. 
anyway, it work. 
always exit- before closing the terminal. check command- for help

why: just for fun, really. I want to test if I can make sth like this myself, as a newbie. I did use AI though, but only for the showing day in month logic, cuz that part is not fun...

status: core built, will revisit in case I want to add new features.
