the previous tic-tac-toe was too basic to be called a small project, so I added some more features, 
and an AI with simple logic so that it doesn't feel awkward playing against yourself in local run :v


status: will revisit if I have time to fix the problem where the X and O cannot zoom alongside the board. 
new features? idk, almost no one gonna visit my repo anytime soon, so I have to think about it hehe:v 
maybe added new 5-in-a-row mode in the future, though it will be a complete rework, not that easy for a newbie like me.



P/S: on a second thought I shouldn't have named the folder like that. Now idk how to change it
