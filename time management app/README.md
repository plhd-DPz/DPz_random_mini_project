this is basically an app that does almost the same as google calendar(but worse).

status: unfinished, will revisit in the future.

features to fix/add:

- allowing user to see their notes in the future, currently the calendar only display current week.

- change the design of the floating button.

- add a feature to manually delete notes that's too far from current time.

- make data.txt easier to be found and does not act weird when user manually changing it.

- fix the bug where if user click the resize button while the floating button in in the edge of the screen, it might disappear due to negative position.

-fix the bug where changing the shape of the window does not change the coordination of the floating button.

- improving UI so that the screen does not appear black for about 0,2s after any changing size option.

- add changing color button(this might be a luxury feature so I'll make it later on after solving all bug above).
